00:00:00.000 --> 00.00.03.500
We're going to conver the number 26 to binary

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00.00.10.500
26 is bigger than 16 so we add 1 to the 16 column

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00.00.15.000
we then take away 16 from 26 which leaves us with 10

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00.00.20.000
10 is bigger than 8 so we add a 1 to the 8 column

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00.00.25.000
and then we take away 8 from 10 which leaves us with 2

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00.00.30.000
2 is smaller than 4 so we add a 0 to the 4 column

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00.00.35.000
2 is equal to 2 so we add a 1 to that column

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00.00.41.000
2 minus 2 is 0 so we add a 0 to the 1 column

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00.00.45.000
converting from binary is even easier

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00.00.50.000
simply add the value of the columns that have 1 in them

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00.00.54.000
so 8 + 4 + 1 = 13
